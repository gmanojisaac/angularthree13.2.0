        &#x27;It was a little moment of revelation, I remember, when I first combined roasted cauliflower and raw grated cauliflower in the same dish. So different from one another, but working so well combined. This is lovely as it is, served as part of a spread, or spooned alongside some roast chicken or lamb. Don’t throw away the leaves of the cauliflower here. They’re lovely to eat, roasted and crisp, or grated raw as you would the rest of the cauliflower. If you want to get ahead, roast the cauliflower up to 4–6 hours in advance. Keep at room temperature and then just combine with the remaining ingredients when ready to serve.&#x27;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Start with the salsa. Combine the vinegar, sumac, sugar, lime peel, garlic and onion in a medium bowl with half a teaspoon of salt, then leave to pickle for at least three hours (and preferably overnight).&#x27;,
        &#x27;To make the hotcake batter, put the buckwheat groats, milk, parmesan, basil, dill and egg yolks in a food processor with half a teaspoon of salt. Whizz on high speed until you have a uniform batter, then tip into a large bowl, stir in 60g ricotta and set to one side. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if the batter discolours after a few minutes: it will brighten up again once fried.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks, then, using a spatula, gradually and gently fold them into the batter: you want to keep as much air in the mixture as possible, so take care not to overwork it.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Drain the pickled onions, discarding the lime peel and garlic, and put them in a medium bowl with the oil, preserved lemon, coriander and a generous grind of pepper. Stir to combine and set aside.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Melt 10g butter in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium-high heat. You&amp;rsquo;ll need about three tablespoons of batter per pancake, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to cook them in batches of two or three at a time, spaced well apart. Once the pancakes are in the pan, fry them for about four minutes, turning halfway, until golden on both sides, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen towel to drain. Keep warm while you repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter as and when you need it. (If you plan to top your hotcakes with fried eggs, make these once all the batter is cooked.)&#x27;,
        &#x27;Serve two or three warm pancakes a portion with the salsa and remaining ricotta (if you&amp;rsquo;re not adding an egg) alongside. Add a final drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of pepper, and serve hot.&#x27;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Preheat the oven to 180C.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Use a little knife to make a small vertical incision – about 6 centimeters long – from the top towards the end of each pepper. You will use this incision to scoop out the seeds later. Arrange the pepper on a roasting tray and place in the oven for 30 minutes, until soft. Remove and set aside to cool before using a small spoon to carefully extract and discard the seeds. The aim is to leave the stem on the peppers when they are stuffed so take your time here: it’s a fiddly job. Peel the skin off the peppers – again, don’t rush here – and set aside on a kitchen paper-lined plate to dry.&#x27;,
        &#x27;To make the filling place the cheeses, nuts, oregano, lemon zest, lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a large bowl. Add half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper and whisk well. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture into each pepper and press evenly inside. Don’t worry if the incision increases in the process: you can use your hands to seal the pepper.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Wipe the peppers clean and place them on individual serving plates. Drizzle 2 teaspoons of olive oil around each pepper and then dot the oil with a few drops of the balsamic. Sprinkle over a few slices of the green chilli and serve.&#x27;,

      description:
        &#x27;This is a wonderful meal on an autumn day, served with a crisp green salad. The slow-cooked chicken is packed full of flavour and the crust – gluten-free, rich and corny – makes for a welcome (and lighter) change to a heavier mash.\nYou can make the chicken well in advance if you want to get ahead: it keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days or can be frozen for 1 month. You want it to go into the oven defrosted, though, so it will need thawing out of the freezer. The batter needs to be made fresh and spooned on top of the chicken just before the dish gets baked, but it then can just go back in the oven. It can also be baked a few hours in advance – just warm through for 10 minutes, covered in foil, before serving. I love the combination of the chicken and the corn, but the chicken also works well as it is, served on top of rice, in a wrap or with a buttery jacket potato.&#x27;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Heat the oil in a large sauté pan, for which you have a lid, on a medium high heat. Add the onions and fry for 8–9 minutes, stirring a few times, until caramelised and soft. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, harissa, paprika, chicken, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, then add the passata and tomatoes. Pour over 350ml of water, bring to the boil, then simmer on a medium heat, covered, for 30 minutes, stirring every once in a while.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Add the peppers and chocolate and continue to simmer for another 35–40 minutes, with the pan now uncovered, stirring frequently, until the sauce is getting thick and the chicken is falling apart. Remove from the heat and stir in the coriander. If you are serving the chicken as it is (as a stew without the batter), it’s ready to serve (or freeze, once it’s come to room temperature) at this stage. If you are making the corn topping, spoon the chicken into a ceramic baking dish – one with high sides that measures about 20 x 30cm – and set aside.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Preheat the oven to 180°C fan.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Pour the butter into a blender with the corn, milk, egg yolks and ¾ teaspoon salt. Blitz for a few seconds, to form a rough paste, then spoon into a large bowl. Place the egg whites in a separate clean bowl and whisk to form firm peaks. Fold these gently into the runny corn mixture until just combined, then pour the mix evenly over the chicken.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Bake for 35 minutes, until the top is golden-brown: keep an eye on it after 25 minutes to make sure the top is not taking on too much colour: you might need to cover it with tin foil for the final 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes before serving.&#x27;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/ gas mark 4. Put the ricotta in the centre of a clean tea towel, squeeze to get rid of some of the liquid, then transfer the cheese to a bowl, season and mix well.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Lightly oil four individual ramekins or one round ovenproof dish about 15cm in diameter (this dish looks great in a brown terracotta one). Spread the ricotta inside and level with a palette knife or a spoon - the cheese should come about 2.5cm up the sides.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Drizzle half the olive oil over the cheese, sprinkle with chopped rosemary and lay a small rosemary sprig on top. Bake for about 20 minutes for individual ramekins, 28 minutes for a large dish, then remove from the oven, top with the figs, drizzle over half the honey and bake again for eight minutes longer. At this point the figs should be semi-cooked but retain their shape.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Remove from the oven and allow to cool down slightly. You can serve the cheese slightly warm or at room temperature.&#x27;,
        &#x27;When ready to serve, whisk together the dressing ingredients in a large bowl. Add the salad leaves and toss. If using individual ramekins, carefully remove the cheese, keeping the figs on top, place on a plate, drizzle the remaining oil and honey on top, and serve with the salad and bread on the side. With the large dish, simply use a large spoon to scoop out a generous portion of cheese and place on the bread slice, making sure some figs are left on top, then drizzle with honey and oil. Place a mound of salad on the side.&#x27;,

        &#x27;It was a little moment of revelation, I remember, when I first combined roasted cauliflower and raw grated cauliflower in the same dish. So different from one another, but working so well combined. This is lovely as it is, served as part of a spread, or spooned alongside some roast chicken or lamb. Don’t throw away the leaves of the cauliflower here. They’re lovely to eat, roasted and crisp, or grated raw as you would the rest of the cauliflower. If you want to get ahead, roast the cauliflower up to 4–6 hours in advance. Keep at room temperature and then just combine with the remaining ingredients when ready to serve.&#x27;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Start with the salsa. Combine the vinegar, sumac, sugar, lime peel, garlic and onion in a medium bowl with half a teaspoon of salt, then leave to pickle for at least three hours (and preferably overnight).&#x27;,
        &#x27;To make the hotcake batter, put the buckwheat groats, milk, parmesan, basil, dill and egg yolks in a food processor with half a teaspoon of salt. Whizz on high speed until you have a uniform batter, then tip into a large bowl, stir in 60g ricotta and set to one side. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if the batter discolours after a few minutes: it will brighten up again once fried.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks, then, using a spatula, gradually and gently fold them into the batter: you want to keep as much air in the mixture as possible, so take care not to overwork it.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Drain the pickled onions, discarding the lime peel and garlic, and put them in a medium bowl with the oil, preserved lemon, coriander and a generous grind of pepper. Stir to combine and set aside.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Melt 10g butter in a large, nonstick frying pan on a medium-high heat. You&amp;rsquo;ll need about three tablespoons of batter per pancake, and you&amp;rsquo;ll need to cook them in batches of two or three at a time, spaced well apart. Once the pancakes are in the pan, fry them for about four minutes, turning halfway, until golden on both sides, then transfer to a plate lined with kitchen towel to drain. Keep warm while you repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter as and when you need it. (If you plan to top your hotcakes with fried eggs, make these once all the batter is cooked.)&#x27;,
        &#x27;Serve two or three warm pancakes a portion with the salsa and remaining ricotta (if you&amp;rsquo;re not adding an egg) alongside. Add a final drizzle of olive oil and a generous grind of pepper, and serve hot.&#x27;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Preheat the oven to 180C.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Use a little knife to make a small vertical incision – about 6 centimeters long – from the top towards the end of each pepper. You will use this incision to scoop out the seeds later. Arrange the pepper on a roasting tray and place in the oven for 30 minutes, until soft. Remove and set aside to cool before using a small spoon to carefully extract and discard the seeds. The aim is to leave the stem on the peppers when they are stuffed so take your time here: it’s a fiddly job. Peel the skin off the peppers – again, don’t rush here – and set aside on a kitchen paper-lined plate to dry.&#x27;,
        &#x27;To make the filling place the cheeses, nuts, oregano, lemon zest, lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of olive oil in a large bowl. Add half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper and whisk well. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture into each pepper and press evenly inside. Don’t worry if the incision increases in the process: you can use your hands to seal the pepper.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Wipe the peppers clean and place them on individual serving plates. Drizzle 2 teaspoons of olive oil around each pepper and then dot the oil with a few drops of the balsamic. Sprinkle over a few slices of the green chilli and serve.&#x27;,

      description:
        &#x27;This is a wonderful meal on an autumn day, served with a crisp green salad. The slow-cooked chicken is packed full of flavour and the crust – gluten-free, rich and corny – makes for a welcome (and lighter) change to a heavier mash.\nYou can make the chicken well in advance if you want to get ahead: it keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days or can be frozen for 1 month. You want it to go into the oven defrosted, though, so it will need thawing out of the freezer. The batter needs to be made fresh and spooned on top of the chicken just before the dish gets baked, but it then can just go back in the oven. It can also be baked a few hours in advance – just warm through for 10 minutes, covered in foil, before serving. I love the combination of the chicken and the corn, but the chicken also works well as it is, served on top of rice, in a wrap or with a buttery jacket potato.&#x27;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Heat the oil in a large sauté pan, for which you have a lid, on a medium high heat. Add the onions and fry for 8–9 minutes, stirring a few times, until caramelised and soft. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, harissa, paprika, chicken, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently, then add the passata and tomatoes. Pour over 350ml of water, bring to the boil, then simmer on a medium heat, covered, for 30 minutes, stirring every once in a while.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Add the peppers and chocolate and continue to simmer for another 35–40 minutes, with the pan now uncovered, stirring frequently, until the sauce is getting thick and the chicken is falling apart. Remove from the heat and stir in the coriander. If you are serving the chicken as it is (as a stew without the batter), it’s ready to serve (or freeze, once it’s come to room temperature) at this stage. If you are making the corn topping, spoon the chicken into a ceramic baking dish – one with high sides that measures about 20 x 30cm – and set aside.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Preheat the oven to 180°C fan.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Pour the butter into a blender with the corn, milk, egg yolks and ¾ teaspoon salt. Blitz for a few seconds, to form a rough paste, then spoon into a large bowl. Place the egg whites in a separate clean bowl and whisk to form firm peaks. Fold these gently into the runny corn mixture until just combined, then pour the mix evenly over the chicken.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Bake for 35 minutes, until the top is golden-brown: keep an eye on it after 25 minutes to make sure the top is not taking on too much colour: you might need to cover it with tin foil for the final 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes before serving.&#x27;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/ gas mark 4. Put the ricotta in the centre of a clean tea towel, squeeze to get rid of some of the liquid, then transfer the cheese to a bowl, season and mix well.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Lightly oil four individual ramekins or one round ovenproof dish about 15cm in diameter (this dish looks great in a brown terracotta one). Spread the ricotta inside and level with a palette knife or a spoon - the cheese should come about 2.5cm up the sides.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Drizzle half the olive oil over the cheese, sprinkle with chopped rosemary and lay a small rosemary sprig on top. Bake for about 20 minutes for individual ramekins, 28 minutes for a large dish, then remove from the oven, top with the figs, drizzle over half the honey and bake again for eight minutes longer. At this point the figs should be semi-cooked but retain their shape.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Remove from the oven and allow to cool down slightly. You can serve the cheese slightly warm or at room temperature.&#x27;,
        &#x27;When ready to serve, whisk together the dressing ingredients in a large bowl. Add the salad leaves and toss. If using individual ramekins, carefully remove the cheese, keeping the figs on top, place on a plate, drizzle the remaining oil and honey on top, and serve with the salad and bread on the side. With the large dish, simply use a large spoon to scoop out a generous portion of cheese and place on the bread slice, making sure some figs are left on top, then drizzle with honey and oil. Place a mound of salad on the side.&#x27;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Simmer the farro in plenty of water for 20 minutes to an hour – the cooking time will depend on the brand; you want it tender with just a little bite. Drain and set aside.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Cook the broad beans in salted boiling water for two minutes, drain, refresh under cold water, then remove and discard the skins.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Mix the chermoula ingredients and season well. Put the fish in a heatproof dish or oven tray lined with baking paper, brush with the chermoula, and roast for eight to 10 minutes, until just done.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Mix the farro, beans, Iranian lime, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a medium pan, heat up gently and divide among four plates. Top with the fish, garnish with dill and serve with a lemon wedge&#x27;,

      description:
        &quot;The Silver Palate, by Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins, is one of the best cookbooks I know and a classic of the 1980s, listing recipes from the first modern quality take-out food shop in New York. Many of the dishes in the book have become legendary. One of them, Chicken Marbella, is the inspiration for this recipe. The chicken needs marinading for at least a day, preferably two, to soften and flavour properly; I wouldn&#x27;t cut corners here.&quot;,

      steps: [
        &#x27;Place the chicken in a large, non-reactive bowl and add all of the ingredients, apart from the wine and date molasses, along with ¾ teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Gently mix everything together, cover the bowl and leave in the fridge to marinate for 1 to 2 days, stirring the ingredients a few times during the process.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Preheat the oven to 180C.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Spread out the chicken legs on a large baking tray, along with all the marinade ingredients. Whisk together the wine and molasses and pour over the meat. Place in the oven and cook for 50 minutes, basting 2 or 3 times, until the meat is golden brown on top and cooked through.&#x27;,
        &#x27;Remove from the oven, transfer everything to a large platter, sprinkle over some freshly picked oregano leaves and serve.&#x27;,
